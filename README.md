# Desserts-Drinks
Web app for finding delicious desserts and drinks in NYC

## Background and Overview



## Functionality & MVP 
* User Auth - a user can signup, login, and logout

* Google API, Yelp API: integrate the google API and populate the map with those stops in our database

* Search - implement search functionality by category (ie. type of drink or dessert), subway stop (ie. 125th st.), filter by ratings (ie. 3 stars and up)

* Popups - display popup (ie. modal) with spot information, such as name, distance from stop, star rating, and photos for the given category (ie. drinks or desserts)

* User favorites - users should be able to save favorite spots to their profile page

* Ratings and comments: 

*productionREADME

## BONUS Features

* Place orders - using the Yelp API, access menu, place items in "cart" that would represent an order during user's journey
* Switching themes after initial choice was selected

## Technologies & Techincal Challenges 

Desserts & Drinks will have a backend built on MongoDB Express for backend. For frontend, we will be using React and Node.js. 

Technical challenges: 

Implementing the Google Map API, marking it up with each subway stop, and integrating the Yelp API to provide users with a list of respective spots. Presenting the users spots as a modal when the map is clicked with independent scroll feature. Searchbar with broad functionality.
